about_me = "My name is Matthew Bressler and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I have concentrations in intelligence and modeling/simulation and am also minoring in Economics. I'm interested in data science/analytics, machine learning, and software engineering. I am also very passionate about baseball analytics. I am currently an analyst for the DI baseball team at Georgia Tech. Prior to that, I was a three year varsity player at Adlai E. Stevenson High School where I was a captain and helped lead my team to a top 8 appearance in the IHSA State Playoffs."
