about_me = "My name is Matthew Bressler and I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in data science/analytics and want to work with baseball in the future. I love all facets of the game. I was a three year varsity player at Adlai E. Stevenson High School where I was a captain my senior year and helped lead my team to a top 8 appearance in the IHSA State Playoffs. I've also worked with developing high school players through a velocity program at MVP Sports Academy in Lake Zurich. I'm currently an analyst/student manager for the D1 baseball team at Georgia Tech."
